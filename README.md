# Boston-housing-price-with-Pyspark
Building A Linear Regression for Boston housing price prediction with PySpark and MLlib 


Apache Spark has become one of the most commonly used and supported open-source tools for machine learning and data science.

This project is the gentle introduction of using Apache Spark’s spark.ml Linear Regression for predicting Boston housing prices. The goal is to come up with a model to predict median value of a given house in the area.

## Data source
Our data is from the Kaggle competition: Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston.
