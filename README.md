# Linear regression in Pyspark with Boston house prices data

Building A Linear Regression for Boston housing price prediction with PySpark and MLlib 


Apache Spark has become one of the most commonly used and supported open-source tools for machine learning and data science.

This project is the gentle introduction of using Apache Sparkâ€™s spark.ml Linear Regression for predicting Boston housing prices. The goal is to come up with a model to predict median value of a given house in the area.

## Data source
Our data is from the Kaggle competition: Housing Values in Suburbs of Boston.
